# Josh's dotfiles

Feel free to inspect these and take what you want from them, but they are designed to make my machine work exactly like I want. You probably do not want to use them as-is unless you happen to be me.

Single line setup; on ChromeOS you must set a root password first! Also, don't forget to change your shell after...
``` bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshsurber/.files/main/install.sh)"
```
