# Josh's dotfiles

Feel free to inspect these and take what you want from them, but they are designed to make my machine work exactly like I want. You probably do not want to use them as-is unless you happen to be me. Everything below is my hints to myself on setting up a new machine.

Copy encrypted ssh tarball from keychain and run

```bash
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshsurber/.files/refs/heads/master/install.sh > install.sh && sh install.sh
```
